# simple-reply-bot

> Available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/torkd/simple-reply-bot)

A Telegram bot to answer messages with predetermined responses.
The answers are defined in the config.json file, and support the response to be triggered by either a normal user or an admin. For ease of use, the docker compose will mount a local directory with such file. The config file can be reloaded at any time with the `/reload` command.
More responses can be added either via the `/addcommand` bot command in a private chat with the bot or by editing the config file. To be able to use `/addcommand`you need to first `/claim` the bot in a private chat with it, or provide your Telegram ID as an environment variable in the compose file.
**Be sure to use a compose file, you can find an example at the bottom.**

## Installation
- Create a `compose.yaml` file in the desired directory. (Example at the bottom of this page.)
	- Provide your local mounting point (be sure Docker will have proper read/write permissions for that directory).
	- Provide your Telegram Bot Token in the `compose.yaml` file as an environment variable
	- **_Optional_** Provide your Telegram ID in the `compose.yaml` file as an environment variable. This will give you ownership of the bot.
- Put your `config.json` file in your local mounting point. (Example at the bottom of this page.)
- Start the container with `docker compose up -d` (`-d` option for `detached` mode; the container will run in the background).

## Commands
Commands with a checkmark in the `Owner` or `Admin` columns require you to be either an admin or the owner.
Commands with a checkmark in the `Private` *only* work in a private chat with the bot.

## Config (config.json)
This is a base config file.
Responses in the `admin` section will only be sent if the command is triggered by an admin.
Responses in the `user` section will be triggered by anyone.
Just add more commands as you please by adding to the JSON dictionary. The key will be the `/command` the bot will respond to, the value will be the actual response.
Responses support [Telegram V2 markdown](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options).

```json
    {
        "admin": {
            "example1": "example 1"
        },
        "user": {
            "example2": "example 2"
        }
    }
```

## Docker compose (compose.yaml)
This is an example of the docker compose file you can use to run the bot.
Make sure to put your `config.json` in the mounted directory, or the container will not start.
If you wish to provide the `OWNER_ID`, make sure to remove the comment.

```yaml
    services:
    bot:
        image: "torkd/simple-reply-bot"
        volumes: 
        - ./config/:/bot/config/
        environment:
        BOT_TOKEN: <BOT_TOKEN>
        #OPTIONAL OWNER_ID: <OWNER_ID>
```
